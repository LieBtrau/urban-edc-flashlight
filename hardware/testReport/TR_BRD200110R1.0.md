## Test incident reports
### TIR1
* Problem: Current is not shut off but output voltage reduced to 3.5V
* Action: Don't use IP3005A again
### TIR2
* Problem: There's not really a hysteresis.  At this voltage it just behaves unstable.
* Action: Don't use IP3005A again
### TIR3
* Problem: When battery terminal is short circuited, the current is about 200mA, can be up to 350mA.  From 400mV battery voltage upwards, the current is limited to 106mA.
* Action: Take notice.
### TIR4
* Problem: Full charge current should only be applied when battery voltage is above 2.8V.  In this circuit, 2.0V seems to be enough for the full charge current.  It doesn't make a difference whether CS is pulled-up by 10㏀ or by a 0Ω link.
* Action: 
### TIR5
* Problem: Battery voltage needs to drop to 3.7V (500mV decrease) before the operation mode returns to full charge.
* Action: Don't use TP5000 part again.
### TIR6
* Problem : Red and green LEDs swapped.  Probably wrong LED placed (don't know what component type of placed component is).
* Action: Check LED component on redesign
### TIR7
* Problem : LEDs not bright enough.
* Action : Change R28 from 100K to 10K.
### TIR8
* Problem : At 3.6V and up, the battery charger starts charging the battery.  The charger current is divided between the load and the battery.  At 3.88V the switch-over occurs and all current is diverted to the load.
* Action : Battery should not be charged as long as it's connected to the load.  Voltage comparator switchover should happen when VIN ≥ 4.5V (Minimum voltage for USB & Li-Ion will never reach that voltage).  The battery charger enable pin should be switched by the comparator as well, to prevent charging when VIN>UVLO of charger, but smaller than 4.5V.

Datasheet proposes a 10㏀ pull-up on CS, but on the TP5000-module it's a solder jumper instead.
